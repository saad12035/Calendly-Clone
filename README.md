My favourite food is pizza and following are some recipe related to it 

In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour, salt, sugar, and yeast. Stir well.

Add the warm water and olive oil to the dry ingredients. Mix until the dough comes together.

Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5 minutes, or until it is smooth and elastic.

Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for about an hour, or until it has doubled in size.

Preheat your oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.

Punch down the dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness.

Place the rolled-out dough on a greased pizza pan or baking sheet.

Spread pizza sauce on top of the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.

Sprinkle cheese over the sauce, and add your desired toppings.

Bake the pizza for 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly.
